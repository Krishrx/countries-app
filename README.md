# Countries App

Welcome to the **Countries App**! This simple and intuitive web application allows you to explore information about countries around the world. It's built using React, Tailwind CSS, and Vite. You can view a list of all countries, read more about each country on Wikipedia, search for specific countries, switch between light and dark modes, and even visualize the top 10 most populated and spoken languages in the world.

You can try out the Countries App [here](https://countries-app-ecru.vercel.app/).

## Features
- **Country List**: Browse a comprehensive list of countries fetched from the REST Countries API.
- **Wikipedia Integration**: Access more detailed information about a country by clicking on the "Know More" button, which redirects you to the Wikipedia page for that country.
- **Search Functionality**: Use the search bar to filter countries based on your search query, making it easy to find a specific country.
- **Light/Dark Mode**: Toggle between light and dark modes for a comfortable viewing experience.
- **Population and Languages Bar Chart**: Explore bar charts that display the top 10 most populated countries and the top 10 most spoken languages in the world.
